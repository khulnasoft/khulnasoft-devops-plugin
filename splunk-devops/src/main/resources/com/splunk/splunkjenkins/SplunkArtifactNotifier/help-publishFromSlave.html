    Publish log files directly from the agent, instead of proxy for the process to the master.
    When publish from agent is selected, Jenkins master will transfer the plugin and its dependence to agent and
    initiate
    the publishing process from the agent.
    Take below into consideration:
    <ul>
        <li>agent and master load
        </li>
        <li>
            log file size
        </li>
        <li>
            agent type, long lived agent or one time use agent
        </li>
    </ul>
    Rule of thumb for selecting publish type:

    <ul>
        <li> a. if log files size is less than 5MB, publish from master is preferred.</li>
        <li> b. if Splunk instance is in an isolated network which is not reachable from agent, you need publish from
            master.
        </li>
    </ul>
